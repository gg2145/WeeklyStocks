# Position Monitor Improvements

### ‚ùå **BEFORE - Problems:**
1. **Pending sell orders were barely visible** - Hidden in small text, easy to miss
2. **Poor organization** - Cramped layout, hard to read
3. **Separate IBKR connection required** - Had to connect manually even when main app was connected
4. **Unclear status** - No clear indication when positions were being sold

### ‚úÖ **AFTER - Solutions:**

## 1. **Crystal Clear Pending Order Visibility**
- **üö® BRIGHT RED ALERT BANNER** when any sell orders are pending
- **Large warning text** shows exactly which stocks are being sold
- **Highlighted table cells** with red backgrounds for pending orders
- **"SELLING" status** prominently displayed for each position

## 2. **Professional Layout & Organization**

- **Clear sections** with headers and borders:

  - Critical Alerts (for pending orders)
